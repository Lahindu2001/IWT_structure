      <p>Life insurance supports your family with money if you pass away. How Insurance Works You pay a small amount of
        money regularly, called a premium, to the insurance company. Many people do this, and the company collects a lot
        of money. Most of the time, nothing bad happens, so the company doesn't need to use all the money.</p>
